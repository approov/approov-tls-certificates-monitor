## RUN THE MONITOR FROM THE HOST

To run the monitor from the host we assume that you already have installed the [Approov CLI](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and it's located somewhere in your `$PATH`, like at `/home/USER_NAME/.local/bin`, thus if you have not installed it, we provide an helper bash script to do it so.
